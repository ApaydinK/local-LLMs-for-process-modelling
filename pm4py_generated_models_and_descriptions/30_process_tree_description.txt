This describes a day work. I start my day when partners want to order books (Order_books). They also need the our proposals about list of books and their prices. That is why I need to review available proposals (Review_proposals) which aims to evaluate and choose the best options. If partners request to have a presentation, then I create one (Create_presentation) where the outline and main content are developed. This step branches into two concurrent sub-tasks: Edit_text to refine the content and Finalize_report to complete the documentation, ensuring a thorough and well-organized workflow from gathering information to finalizing deliverables. The report will be editted until it is perfect. According to the final report, the proposals will be again reviewed. The process is iterated until the proposals are carefully reviewed
