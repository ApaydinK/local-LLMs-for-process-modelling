This describes a day of work. I start my day when customers want to order books (Order_books). They ask me about our proposals of books and their prices. That is why I need to review available proposals (Review_proposals) which aims to evaluate and choose the best options. At this point most times the customer buys the book, but sometimes they need some more information. If customers request to have a presentation, then I create one (Create_presentation) where the outline and main content of the book are shown. This step branches into two concurrent sub-tasks: Edit_text to refine the content of my presentation and Finalize_report to complete the documentation, ensuring a thorough and well-organized workflow from gathering information to finalizing deliverables. The report will be edited until it is perfect. According to the final report, the proposals will be again reviewed. The process is iterated until the proposals are carefully reviewed.
