This process begins with Order Books, setting the foundation for gathering necessary materials. It then moves into Review Proposals, which aim to evaluate and choose the best options. Following this, the process proceeds to Create Presentation, where the outline and main content are developed. This step branches into two concurrent activities: Edit Text to refine the content and Finalize Report to complete the documentation, ensuring a thorough and well-organized workflow from gathering information to finalizing deliverables.
