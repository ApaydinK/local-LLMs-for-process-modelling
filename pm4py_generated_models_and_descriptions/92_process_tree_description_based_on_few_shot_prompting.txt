**Description:**

The process begins with either developing a marketing strategy or researching market conditions. Once these initial steps are complete, the focus shifts to reviewing financial statements.

In parallel, another subprocess is triggered. This subprocess starts by identifying key performance indicators (KPIs). With these KPIs in place, two activities can occur simultaneously: planning a product launch and analyzing sales trends.

The entire process involves developing a marketing strategy, researching market conditions, reviewing financial statements, and planning a product launch while analyzing sales trends to inform the development of a budget report.
