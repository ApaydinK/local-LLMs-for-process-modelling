Use case: E-commerce case, Inventory control
The process starts with two separate processes which both need to finish. First someone has to Confirm the Shipment Details, ensuring that all logistics information is accurate and up to date. Concurrently, someone handles the inventory report, which provides a detailed account of available stock. Following these steps, he passes a list of Ordered Goods to other team members, where new items are requested from suppliers. This is followed by processing the Customer Payment, ensuring that payment transactions are completed successfully. The payment controller completes this task. While this is happening workers package the items, which involves preparing the product for delivery, and label the package if it is necessary, ensuring the package is correctly addressed and ready for shipment. The workers have continuously package items and label packages and end up their daily work at the end of the day or when the orders are out of stock.
