I start by creating a product design. Always, I prepare a prototype, after which I design the product. Sometimes I am finished and that point, but mostly, I test the prototype, after which I get back to designing the product. Sometimes, after creating the product design, I receive an order from a customer. This might happen several times in a row, with a special step in between that I will just call 'e'. Afterwards, I process the payment, again potentially several times. In that case, a special step called 'f' is required. After processing the payment, I must start again with creating a process design.
