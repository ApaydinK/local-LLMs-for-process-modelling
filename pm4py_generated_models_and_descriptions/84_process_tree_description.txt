This process has two child processes that run in separate at the same time. The first one gets into Get Order. Possibly this leads into a short loop with Bill Customer. Otherwise, this subprocess is already over. The other subprocess starts with both File Invoice and Process Invoices. The latter can go into a short loop with Update Database. If it does not, and File Invoice is completed, then it is either Confirm Shipment or Handle Order. Following that, the process gets into File Invoice, then Confirm Shipment, and then back into the beginning of the second subprocess. If it does not go into File Invoice and if Get Order hast been completed, then the whole process can end.
