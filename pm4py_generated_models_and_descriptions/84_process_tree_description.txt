The process begins with handling invoices and orders in parallel with obtaining orders and billing customers. Initially, there is a sequence where filing an invoice triggers the process. This sequence involves two parallel tasks: processing invoices, where invoices are verified and processed, and updating the database with the processed invoice information. Alongside, there is a choice between handling orders, which involves processing orders or updating their status, and confirming shipment, which involves confirming the shipment with the customer.

Simultaneously, there is a loop of obtaining orders from the system and billing customers, where orders are repeatedly retrieved and invoices are generated and sent to customers. This comprehensive process ensures efficient handling of invoices and orders, database updates, shipment confirmations, and continuous order retrieval and customer billing.
