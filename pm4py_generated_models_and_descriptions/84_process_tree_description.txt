The process begins with handling invoices and orders in parallel with obtaining orders and billing customers. Initially, there is a sequence where filing an invoice triggers the process. This sequence involves two parallel tasks: processing invoices, where invoices are verified and processed, and updating the database with the processed invoice information. Alongside, there is a choice between handling orders, which involves processing orders or updating their status, and confirming shipment, which involves confirming the shipment with the customer.

Simultaneously, there is a loop of obtaining orders from the system and billing customers, where orders are repeatedly retrieved and invoices are generated and sent to customers. This comprehensive process ensures efficient handling of invoices and orders, database updates, shipment confirmations, and continuous order retrieval and customer billing.

This process has to sub processes that run in parallel. The first one gets into Get Order. Possibly this leads into a short loop with Bill Customer. Otherwise, this subprocess is already over. The other subprocess starts with both File Invoice and Process Invoices. The latter can go into a short loop with Update Database. If it does not, and File Invoice is completed, then it is either Confirm Shipment or Handle Order. Following that, the process gets into File Invoice, then Confirm Shipment, and then back into the beginning of the second subprocess. If it does not go into File Invoice and if Get Order hast been completed, then the whole process can end.
