The process begins with packaging materials and involves several steps. Initially, data is extracted from various sources, followed by verifying user identity before proceeding further. After account verification, the next steps include validating health records and subsequently approving or rejecting the grant application based on the validation results. Concurrently, there are other tasks being performed such as preparing orders for packaging materials, sourcing fresh fruit for the packaging, and packing eggs as part of the packaging materials. This comprehensive process ensures data extraction, account verification, health record validation, grant application approval, and the simultaneous preparation of packaging materials including fresh fruit and eggs.

The process starts with package materials. It can end right there. If it does not, depending on the situation, it goes on with Process Order and either Pack Eggs or Source Fresh Fruit, and then back to package materials. Or it proceeds with Extract Data. From there it can branch back to Package Materials, loop over Verify Account, Validate Health Records, and Approve Grant Application. That loop only ever stops between Verify Account and Validate Health Records, when another round of Extract Data is required.
