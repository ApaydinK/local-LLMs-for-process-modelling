The process starts with packaging materials. It can end right there. If it does not, depending on the situation, it goes on with Process Order and either Pack Eggs or Source Fresh Fruit, and then back to package materials. Or it proceeds with Extract Data. From there it can branch back to Package Materials, loop over Verify Account, Validate Health Records, and Approve Grant Application. That loop only ever stops between Verify Account and Validate Health Records, when another round of Extract Data is required.
