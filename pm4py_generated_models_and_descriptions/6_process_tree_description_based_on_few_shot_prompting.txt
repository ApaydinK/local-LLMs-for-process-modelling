process tree structure: *( +( 'Prepare Order', 'Review Payment' ), +( 'Authorize Payment', *( 'Process Refund', *( 'Collect Personal Data', 'Verify Information' ) ) ) )

This process starts by preparing an order and reviewing a payment or by reviewing a payment and preparing an order. Once the initial two steps are completed in any order, the process ends or the focus shifts to authorizing the payment and processing a refund. Here, it does not matter again of the refund is first processed and the the payment is authorized. Now is an interesting part of the process, after the refund is processed, personal data coud be collected and then verfied multiple times. if the verification is not necessary anymore this path of the process goes back to the the processement of the refund. If the payment is authorized and the process is refunded, the entire process starts again. The whole loop can only be stopped after executing the initial two steps reviewing a payment and preparing an order.
