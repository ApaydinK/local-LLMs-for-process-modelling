The process starts with placing an order. In some cases, that is all there is to do, and we are done. Most often, after placing an order we need to both process the payment and check the payment. When processing the payment, we need to take care of packaging, and then maybe preparing an order and packaging again. When done with packaging and checking the payment, we can place another order, which may or may not end the process.
