My work can be boring at times. It so happens, that I just need to order materials or pack furniture and thats it. Other times, I am also required to clean carpets after packing furniture and then they ask me to pack even more furniture and clean even more carpets. Only when they think I have packed anough furniture they leave me alone again. What I have described is my daily work. However it also happend several times that after doing my daily work I was put to the task to assemble a desk and then a bookshelf, one time after assembling a desk I even needed to edit documents. And is nothing happend I just returned to my daily work again.
