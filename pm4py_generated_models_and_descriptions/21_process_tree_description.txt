My work can be boring at times. It so happens, that I just need to order materials or pack furniture and that’s it. Other times, I am also required to clean carpets after packing furniture and then they ask me to pack even more furniture and clean even more carpets. Only when they think I have packed enough furniture they leave me alone again. What I have described is my daily work. However, it also happened several times that after doing my daily work I was put to the task to assemble a desk and then a bookshelf, one time after assembling a desk I even needed to edit documents. After that I also had to do my daily work again at the same day.
