process tree structure: *( *( ->( ->( 'SendPackages', 'ProcessReturns' ), *( 'VerifyProductQuality', 'StoreData' ) ), +( 'CreateInvoice', 'GetNewStock' ) ), ->( 'PrepareOrder', 'ManageCustomer' ) )What a delightful process tree! Let me break it down for you.

Start your day always by sending all packages first and then processing the collected returns from the day before. When you are done with all packages, verify the quality of new products that the manager shows to you, sometimes you will need to store all relevant data to a database and verify the product quality for different conditions. On a busy day your work already ends with these tasks. However if you have time then prepare orders and help team A by managing some of their customers. In this case do what you would do for your own customers, i.e. first send packages and then process the returns before doing the product quality verifications and storage of data when necessary. In other cases when you have time and team A does not need assistance get some need stock and create invoices for team B.
