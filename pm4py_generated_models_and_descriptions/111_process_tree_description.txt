The process starts with preparing an inventory, which is a crucial step in ensuring that all necessary items are available and accounted for. After the inventory is prepared, the next step is to conduct quality control measures to verify that the products meet certain standards or specifications. Depending on the results of the quality control checks, one of two paths may be taken. If no corrective actions are needed, the process can move forward with authorizing the shipment of the products. However, if issues are found during quality control, a corrective action needs to be implemented to address the problems before shipping can occur.
