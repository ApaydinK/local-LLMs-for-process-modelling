Use Case: Project management workflow

When we have decided on a new project we do many things at the same time. The Analytics team needs to Conduct Interviews, where they gather qualitative insights about markets or competitors. Other parallel work is the task to Analyze Data, which involves examining and interpreting the information collected. This can be done while we do other important work like c. If the boss requires to continue the project, then a Report is created, where findings are documented and summarized, focusing on overseeing and coordinating project activities. Then the project is managed by a manager if necessary and before that a report is continuously created if further updates come. Then our process starts again with our new data we gathered.
