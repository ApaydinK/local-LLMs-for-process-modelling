This process can be finished quickly but sometimes it takes more input and feedback. So sometimes the organization just creates a report and then the process is already finished. In other instances the organization reviews a document and then prepares a research proposal, because they feel so inspired by the new information. The proposal then is finalized by analyzing findings and making any necessary adjustments or gathering additional data to be presented. However, sometimes additional information is needed. In this case, a meeting with the professor is scheduled as well as a video call with the project partner is hold. The meeting with the professor and the project partners are independend from each other. Also a decision has to be made about inviting more collaborators with expertise or simply conduct a brainstorming session to gather ideas from the people already involved in the proposal. If additional information is gathered in this way, then the process is kicked off again, i.e. either a report is created or the new document is reviewed etc.
