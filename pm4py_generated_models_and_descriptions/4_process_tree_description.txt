Sometimes the organization just creates a report and then the process is already finished. In other instances, the organization reviews a document and then prepares a research proposal. The proposal then is finalized by analyzing findings or gathering additional data to be presented. However, sometimes additional information is needed. In this case, a meeting with the professor is scheduled as well as a video call with the project partner is hold. The meeting with the professor and the project partners are independent from each other. Also, a decision must be made about inviting more collaborators with expertise or simply conduct a brainstorming session to gather ideas from the people already involved in the proposal. If additional information is gathered in this way, then the process is kicked off again, i.e. either a report is created, or the new document is reviewed etc.
