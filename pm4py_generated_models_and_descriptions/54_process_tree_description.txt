This is a looping process. It begins with the parallel execution of 'Receive Order' on the one hand and the parallel execution of 'Inspect Order Details' and 'Confirm with Customer' on the other hand. Then either the process terminates, or the following happens. In Parallel, we see the choice of either 'Evaluate Order' or 'Cancel', and the parallel execution of the sequence of 'Send Confirmation Email' and then 'Update Database', and the choice of 'Notify Customer' or 'Archive Order'. In this case, the process loops back to the very beginning, repeating the whole process.
