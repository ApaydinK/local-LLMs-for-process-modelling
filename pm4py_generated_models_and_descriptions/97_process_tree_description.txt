The process begins with generating code, after which the process may abruptly end. If it does not, it continues with writing a unit test. Following that, it is either both integrating a module and a choice of testing a case or adding a feature, with no regards to the order. After that, it is back to writing unit tests. Or, after writing unit tests you may instead take care of releasing an update, which directly leads to designing a pattern. This in turn forces you to generate code again. The process can only ever end directly after generating code.
