Use Case: Recruitment

This process starts with Send Invitation, setting the stage for further activities. It then offers two parallel paths: Wait Response, to anticipate feedback, or a sequence where Prepare Report and Fill Form are done simultaneously. In the next phase, there are two sets of alternatives: one is to Conduct Interview and Gather Data, focusing on collecting detailed information, while the other involves Call Meeting and Hold Discussion sequentially, facilitating planning and decision-making.
