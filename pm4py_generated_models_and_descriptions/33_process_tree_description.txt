Use Case: Conducting Event or Recruitment

When a recruitment is requested an invitation for interviews or for events will be sent and simultaneously representatives wait for responses or if the response already happened a form is filled, and a report is getting prepared in unison. After that the process is finished if there is no response or the decision has been done. Alternatively, the recruitment process continues. Either by a meeting or an interview.  If a meeting is chosen a Call Meeting has been done and after that a discussion about the participants is hold. If the Interview is chosen the interview is conducted and if necessary, further data is gathered and another interview has been organized. After both possibilities the process restarts.
