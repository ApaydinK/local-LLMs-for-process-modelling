The expected description is:

This process starts with creating a proposal for a marketing campaign, which can be done in parallel with developing a sales strategy. The creation of the marketing campaign proposal involves reviewing and approval by a manager, as well as finalizing or collaborating on the sales strategy. 

In the meantime, the development of the sales strategy involves conducting market research and analyzing results. These two subprocesses do not depend on each other, and can be performed concurrently.

Overall, this process tree represents a complex marketing campaign planning process that requires both strategic planning (creating a proposal) and data-driven decision-making (conducting market research). The outcome is a finalized sales strategy that is reviewed and approved by a manager.
