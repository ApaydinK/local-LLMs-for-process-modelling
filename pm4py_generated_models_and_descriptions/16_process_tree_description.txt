Here, I am going to describe the entire process to publish a book with our agency. If you want to publish a finalized version of your book please follow and execute all steps we list in the "PublishFinalize" step, which includes any necessary formatting, proofreading, or other preparations for publication by yourself. Afterwards a professional review is executed by us. The other option is to design your book together with us. By this option we enter the phase of designing the book, creating a concept, as well as refining the design and editing the details together. We offer to you to do the refinement of the design and the edit of the details until you are satisfied. If after multiple iterations you are still not happy, then we will restart the design of the book with a new designer for you who creates a new concept and again refines the design as well as edits the details as necessary until you are happy with the result.
