Use Case: Conducting a Research Study with Stakeholder Feedback
First off in the day we have a meeting to review our progress, that repeats at the end of the day. After that I either work on my study or sometimes I work on its presentation. Working on my study contains to assign my tasks and conduct the research study, if I find new data I will analyze it and then continue with my study. When this is finished, I continue with another meeting to review my new findings. If I work on a new presentation I try to gather all information of my study and I try to make it presentable. This includes writing a report while I prepare the presentation and obtain feedback by the stakeholders. When both parts are finished, I present my Presentation in the Review Meeting.
