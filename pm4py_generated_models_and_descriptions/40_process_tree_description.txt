Use Case: Process Customer Order, might be common workflow in e-commerce
This process begins with the Process “Customer Order”, handling the initial stages of an order. On Friday the work ends here. On other days, it then moves to Verify Product Availability, ensuring that the requested items are in stock. Afterwards the customers’ orders are again processed or followed by 2 branches. One of that is to Prepare Shipping, where workers must double check the items in the Shipping Box. Besides preparing shipping, workers also Process Order, completing the order procedures, and then Ship Package, ensuring the package is sent to the customer.  If something is missing during these two things workers need to again verify the product availability.
