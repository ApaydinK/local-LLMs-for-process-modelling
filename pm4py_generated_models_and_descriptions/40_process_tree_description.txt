Use Case: Process Customer Order, might be common workflow in e-commerce
This process begins with Process Customer Order, handling the initial stages of an order. On Friday the work ends here. On other days, it then moves to Verify Product Availability, ensuring that the requested items are in stock. Afterward, customer orders are again processed or followed by 2 branches. One of that is to Prepare Shipping Box, where workers have to double check the items in the Shipping Box. Besides preparing Shipping Box, workers also Process Order, completing the order procedures, and then Ship Package, ensuring the package is sent to the customer.  if something is missing during Preparing Shipping Box or after Shipping Package, workers need to again verify the product availability.
