Use Case: Recruitment
When I started my company, I needed people to work for me. So, I decided to interview the first candidate myself. But while the company has grown, I recognized the problem that I wasn’t able to do this alone. So, I decided to hire a manager. But shortly after the manager couldn’t handle the work either. Also, the workers were not trained well enough. To solve this, we did two things at the same time. First, we found a trainer and trained him to train our workers. After that we secured it that our workers were trained by our trainer. Secondly, we had two options. Either we could hire a committee, which then would evaluate the resumes of our candidates, or we could recruit a recruiter to recruit new recruits. The recruiter would do that by screening the applicants and if necessary, do a group interview and then screen the remaining applicants. This could also make it possible for the recruiter to recruit another recruiter to help with his work. At the end we choose one option but recognized that we could need both options. After we have done that, we hired another manager to manage all the new workers. This kept going until we had all the workers we needed.
