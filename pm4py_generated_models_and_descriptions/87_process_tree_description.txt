This process has a lot of choices to be made. One option would be to start with Finalize Design. Then the process can either end, or we Build a prototype, which then loops back to Finalize Design. Or we have the choice of Gather Requirements (again, potentially ending the process, or leading to Analyze Data, which loops back to Gather Requirements), or the third option where we can choose one of Create Report, Deliver Report, or Edit Report. After these choices the process terminates.
