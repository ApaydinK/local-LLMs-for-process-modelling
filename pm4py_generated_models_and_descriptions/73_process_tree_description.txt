We begin by reviewing a proposal. This can already end the job. But it can also be necessary to create a report (potentially offering a job and going back to creating a report), then conducting an interview panel (potentially hiring an employee and going back to conducting and interview panel), before finally going back to the review proposal. Apart from this, the review proposal could also be followed by evaluating an application or by conducting an interview as well as shortlisting candidates. Either way, this also means going back to the review proposal. This is the only step, after which the job can normally end.
