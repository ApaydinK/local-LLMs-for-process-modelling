The first half of the process can take any of two directions. I can check the inventory and pack fresh fruits. Order does not matter here. Or I need to either prepare or wrap gifts. Anyway, when that is done, the second part comes. I start with a delivery. Sometimes, that's it and we are done. Mostly, I need to either check the status or give orders, then do a delivery again.
