process tree structure: ->( X( +( 'Check Inventory', 'Pack Fresh Fruits' ), X( 'Prepare', 'Wrap Gifts' ) ), *( 'Deliver', X( 'Check Status', 'Orders' ) ) )

The process begins with two parallel choices: checking inventory and packing fresh fruits, or preparing and wrapping gifts. Once these tasks are completed, the process moves into a loop where it repeatedly delivers the items and either checks the status of existing orders or processes new orders until all orders are fulfilled.
