############## Improve Description - e.g. that does a parallel choice mean? #####################
The process begins with two parallel choices: checking inventory and packing fresh fruits, or preparing and wrapping gifts. Once these tasks are completed, the process moves into a loop where it repeatedly delivers the items and either checks the status of existing orders or processes new orders until all orders are fulfilled.

The first half of the process can take any of two directions. Either I check the inventory and pack fresh fruits. Order does not matter here. Or I need to either make preparations or wrap gifts. Anyway, when that is done, the second part comes. I start with a delivery. Sometimes, that's it and we are done. Mostly, I need to either check the status or give orders, then do a delivery again.
