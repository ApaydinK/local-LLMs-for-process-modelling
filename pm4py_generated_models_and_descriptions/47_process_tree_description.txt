Use Case: Report for Client
As a consultant, the daily work is to prepare report for client or create presentation. Those can be done if the customers satisfy with the results. Otherwise, there are two tasks to work on. First task is to provide feedback to collaborator to ask for review and approve documents.The second task is to send follow up email to customers, offering a choice between Schedule Meeting with Stakeholder to facilitate discussions or Follow up on Open Tickets to address pending issues. Both tasks continue with reports and presentations which will be again prepared and handed over again  if neccessary or external requests from customer.
