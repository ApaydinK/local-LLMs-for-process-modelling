Use Case: Report for Client
As a consultant, the daily work is to show our client the new information we gathered. This contains two separate tasks, the preparation of a report and the creation of a presentation. If our customer is happy with our work this is all we need to do. But if he is not happy, we need to do more. We then have two options. Option one is to provide feedback to our collaborators to work with them on a better solution. When this is finished, we review the documents of our collaborators and approve these documents. Then we rerun the whole process. The second option is to send a follow up email to our customers to organize a new meeting for a solution, offering a choice between scheduling a meeting with stakeholder to facilitate discussions or to follow up on our open tickets to address pending issues and work out their problems with our work. Both options continue with a rerun of the process until our customer is satisfied with our work.
