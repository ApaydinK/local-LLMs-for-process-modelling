The process starts with 'process_orders'. Then comes 'handle_customer_service", while simultaneously the following happens: Two sub processes start in parallel. In one, either 'manage_inventory' happens, or 'conduct_quality_control' appears. In the other, 'check_order_availability' is executed. Afterwards, either 'ship_products' happens and then 'check_order_availability' again, triggering a loop. If both subprocesses are ready the process ends.
