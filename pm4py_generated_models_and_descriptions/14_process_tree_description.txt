The goal of this process is to enhance an existing software product by adding new features while ensuring compatibility and quality. The process starts by designing a prototype. The prototype can be refined by developing algorithms and integrating new features to the existing software. All the designing, developing and integrating steps are performed several times until finally one group is responsible to analyze improvement results or therefore conduct experiments repeatedly and parallelly another group is responsible for either implementing the changes or testing compatibility. While testing the compatibility errors can get recognized and debugged. After the debug is finished it is possible to fix the bug and then further debug the error until it is solved. When the error is solved the testing of the compatibility is continued until no errors are left and the process is finished after both groups have finished their work.
