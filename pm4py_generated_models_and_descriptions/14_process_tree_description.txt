process tree structure: ->( *( 'Design Prototype', *( 'Develop Algorithm', 'Integrate New Feature' ) ), +( X( 'Conduct Experiment', 'Analyze Results' ), X( 'Implement Change', *( 'Test Compatibility', *( 'Debug Error', 'Fix Bug' ) ) ) ) )What a delightful process tree!

The goal of this process is to enhance an existing software product by adding new features while ensuring compatibility and quality. The process involves designing a prototype, developing algorithms and integrating new features to the existing software. All of the designing, developing and integrating steps are performed a number of times until finally one group is responsible to analyze improvement results and therefore conduct experiments repeatedly and parallelly another group is responsible for either implementing the changes or testing compatibility, often debugging several errors and fixing various bugs.
