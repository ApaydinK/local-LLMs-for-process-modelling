Here's the process description based on this tree:

**Process:** Develop and Implement a New Product or Service

**Main Process:** Order Materials (X)

The main process starts with ordering materials for the new product or service. This involves two sub-processes: Source Suppliers and Evaluate Proposals.

* **Source Suppliers**: Identify potential suppliers of raw materials, components, or services necessary for the product.
* **Evaluate Proposals**: Assess the proposals from various suppliers based on factors such as quality, price, reliability, and lead time.

**Parallel Branch:** Design Product (X) and Prepare Site (X)

The main process then splits into two parallel branches:

1. **Design Product**: This branch involves designing the new product or service. It consists of three subprocesses:
	* Assemble Components: Develop the components that will make up the final product.
	* Test Product: Conduct testing to validate the design and ensure it meets requirements.
2. **Prepare Site**: This branch prepares the site for implementation, including two subprocesses:
	* Install Equipment: Set up any necessary equipment or infrastructure.
	* Commission System: Ensure all systems are go and ready for use.

**Final Branch:** Track Progress (X) and Identify Issues (X)

The parallel branches converge at this point. The final process involves tracking progress and identifying issues:

1. **Track Progress**: Monitor the development and implementation of the product or service, ensuring it stays on track.
2. **Identify Issues**: Address any problems or obstacles that arise during the process.

This process tree effectively models a complex development project that requires careful planning, coordination, and execution.
