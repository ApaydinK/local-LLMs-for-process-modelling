In the current process, we start off with a choice of two sub processes. The first sub process starts with 'Receive Inventory', followed either by 'Verify Quality' which loops back to 'Receive Inventory', or followed by the termination of the process. The second sub process also starts off with a choice. It is either 'Ehip Products', then 'Deliver Goods', then the process ends. Or it is the parallel execution of 'Process Payment' and the sequence of 'Order Parts' and 'Prepare Packaging'. 'Prepare Packaging' can either lead to 'Label and Tag', which calls for a repeated 'Prepare Packaging', or it can lead to the process ending if also 'Process Payment' has been finished.
