Process Tree: X( 'Conduct Interview', X( 'Review Document', +( 'Plan Meeting', X( 'Schedule Follow-up', 'Send Report' ) ) ) )

Description:

The process starts with conducting an interview. After the interview, a document is reviewed, which may lead to planning a meeting and scheduling follow-ups. However, another possible path emerges when sending a report is necessary. The two parallel activities - planning the meeting and sending the report - do not depend on each other.

To summarize: the process begins with conducting an interview, followed by reviewing a document, which can then trigger either planning a meeting or sending a report. These activities occur independently of each other, allowing for multiple possible paths through the process.
