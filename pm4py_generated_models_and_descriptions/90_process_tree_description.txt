The process starts with planning the project, where the scope, goals, and timelines are defined. Once planning is complete, a detailed blueprint is created to guide subsequent activities. Following this, the process branches into two parallel paths. One path focuses on designing the overall architecture of the project. The other path involves two activities that can be executed concurrently: testing a prototype to validate the design and identify potential issues, and developing software components that will be part of the overall system. This process model illustrates a realistic scenario for developing a complex system or software product, ensuring that high-level planning and detailed design are completed before implementation.
