process tree structure: +( X( 'Conduct Interviews', *( 'Review Budget', X( 'Evaluate Options', +( 'Finalize Features', X( 'Develop Design', 'Generate Requirements' ) ) ) ) ), ->( 'Prepare Proposal', 'Hire Candidate' ) )

Use Case: Recruitment Process
This process model starts with Prepare Proposal, drafting a comprehensive plan, and then Hire Candidate, finalizing the selection of personnel. Concurrently, another path proceeds to Conduct Interviews, gathering important information. It then branches into Review Budget, a detailed examination of financial resources. This step offers two alternatives: Evaluate Options, assessing various possibilities, or a sequence involving Finalize Features, defining the key elements, followed by a choice between Develop Design, creating a detailed plan, or Generate Requirements, listing essential criteria.
