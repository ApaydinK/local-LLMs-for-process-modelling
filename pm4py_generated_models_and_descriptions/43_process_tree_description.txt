Use Case: Recruitment Process
During the recruitment process the recruiting team and I always need to prepare a proposal, drafting a comprehensive plan, and then hire candidate at the end. While I do that, the team conducts interviews, gathering important information about new candidates. Or they review the budget to make sure that we have enough budget for new workers. If we find that the budget is limited, we try to either evaluate our options or we finalize our features, while also developing a design or we generate new requirements. After that we continue with our regular work.
