The process presented here starts with two parallel branches. The first branch contains the activity 'Write Report'. The second branch is the simultaneous execution of two subbranches. The first subbranch is either 'Analyze Data' and 'Create Presentation' in parallel order, or the choice of either 'Send Email' or 'conduct Interview'. The second subbranch is both 'Make Phone Call' and 'Review Documents' in any order. After 'Write Report' and both subbranches are done, the process terminates.
