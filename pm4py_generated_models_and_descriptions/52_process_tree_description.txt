The process presented here starts with two parallel branches. The first branch contains the activity 'Write Report'. The second branch is the simultaneous execution of two sub branches. The first sub branch is either 'Analyze Data' and 'Create Presentation' in parallel order, or the choice of either 'Send Email' or 'conduct Interview'. The second sub branch is both 'Make Phone Call' and 'Review Documents' in any order. After 'Write Report' and both sub branches, the process terminates.
