The process starts with the Sales Team and the Marketing Department working in parallel. In the Sales Team branch, the team first engages in Meeting Preparation, setting the stage for a successful meeting, followed by Setting Up Materials, where they gather necessary items such as presentation slides and product demos. Simultaneously, the Marketing Department focuses on Creating Content, developing materials like blog posts, social media campaigns, and video scripts to engage their target audience.

In the Overseeing branch, a supervisory role ensures the overall process is on track. This branch includes Implementing Features, where new functionalities are integrated into a product or service. The process then reaches a decision point with two options: Feature Development, where the team develops new features or enhances existing ones, and Conducting Tests, where tests are performed to validate the quality and effectiveness of the developed features.
