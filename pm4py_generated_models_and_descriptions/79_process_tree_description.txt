############## Improve Description - e.g. the marketing department is creating content only after the prior activities and not simultaneously to them #####################

The process starts with the Sales Team and the Marketing Department working in parallel. In the Sales Team branch, the team first engages in Meeting Preparation, setting the stage for a successful meeting, followed by Setting Up Materials, where they gather necessary items such as presentation slides and product demos. Simultaneously, the Marketing Department focuses on Creating Content, developing materials like blog posts, social media campaigns, and video scripts to engage their target audience.

In the Overseeing branch, a supervisory role ensures the overall process is on track. This branch includes Implementing Features, where new functionalities are integrated into a product or service. The process then reaches a decision point with two options: Feature Development, where the team develops new features or enhances existing ones, and Conducting Tests, where tests are performed to validate the quality and effectiveness of the developed features.

With this process, two lines of work commence immediately. The first one consists of contacting the sales team and preparing a meeting. Next, I contact the marketing department. Often, this is where my job ends, but sometimes, I have to create content, before contacting the marketing department again. I might need to take a few turns on this one. The other line of work begins with overseeing work. Either the process ends there (after I have also contacted marketing department), or I have to implement features. Then it is either going back to overseeing,  or one of developing features or conducting tests. That means going back to implementing features.
