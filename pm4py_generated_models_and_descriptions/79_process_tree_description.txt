With this process, two lines of work commence immediately. The first one consists of contacting the sales team and preparing a meeting followed by setting up the materials. Next, I contact the marketing department. Often, this is where my job ends, but sometimes, I have to create content, before contacting the marketing department again. I might need to take a few turns on this one. The other line of work begins with overseeing work. Either the process ends there (after I have also contacted marketing department), or I must implement features. Then it is either going back to overseeing, or one of developing features or conducting tests. That means going back to implementing features. Only if I finished both lines my work is done.
