process tree structure: +( 'Download Files', X( X( 'Analyze Error', ->( 'Send Report', *( 'Gather Data', 'Process File' ) ) ), +( 'Prepare Data', X( 'Extract Features', 'Train Model' ) ) ) )

The process begins with Downloading Files, which involves obtaining relevant datasets from various sources. Next, Analyze Error is performed to understand the nature of the errors, which may involve manual review or automated tools. The process then takes two parallel paths: 

In the first path, Gather Data involves collecting information about the software application, such as logs or configuration files, followed by Process File, which includes tasks like parsing log files or transforming raw data. 

In the second path, Prepare Data involves cleaning, formatting, or aggregating data, followed by Extract Features, which identifies key characteristics or features in the data for model development. Finally, Train Model uses the extracted features to train a machine learning model. The process then combines these two paths, and a Send Report summarizing the findings is generated and sent to stakeholders. This simplified process tree represents a scenario where data scientists analyze software applications to identify potential errors, streamlining the steps involved in the analysis.
