When I will start downloading my files, I also have a choice to make. Either it is a choice between analyzing an error or sending a report. Or it is preparing data while also either extracting features or training a model. When sending a report, I also always gather data. Following up on gathering data, it may happen that I must process a file, before I gather data again.
