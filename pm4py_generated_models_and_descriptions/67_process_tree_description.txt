Let me start off by saying that the following process can loop several times. I start with Order Parts. In some cases, that is all, and my work is finished. In other cases, there is several things that I must do. I Assemble Frame. This can lead to Attach Handles, which then always means Assemble Frame again. But Attach Handles is optional. I also Unpack Components. This is independent of Assamble Frame and not in any particular temporal order. And I also Connect Brackets, Install Wheels and Pack Final Product in any order I see fit. When these three parts (the Unpack part, the Assemble Frame - Attach Handles part, and the Connect/Install/Pack part) are done, this iteration is complete and I go back repeat the whole process, starting at Order parts.
