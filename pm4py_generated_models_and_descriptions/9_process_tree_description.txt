The first step involves ordering a package, which is commonly done as the only task of the entire process. However, the full process contains several more steps that are also commonly executed. The process involves reviewing invoices after ordering packages, then creating a quote where terms need to be included. The creation of quotes and inclusion of terms can be done again and again until the final quote is created where then a decision is made between offering a discount or choosing a payment method. From here either the process restarts with order package or a propasal needs to be send. When a proposal is sent an invoice is reviewed again and it continues as described previosly from the review of the invoice or when its urgent, a deadline needs to be meet sometimes this requires to gather requirements on what to achieve. It is possible that several deadlines need to be meet. As soon as a dealine needs to be meet that does not require to gather more requirements, the process restarts with order package.
