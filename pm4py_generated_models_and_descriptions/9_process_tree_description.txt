process tree structure: *( 'Order Package', *( ->( ->( 'Review Invoice', *( 'Create Quote', 'Include Terms' ) ), X( 'Choose Payment Method', 'Offer Discount' ) ), *( 'Send Proposal', *( 'Meet Deadline', 'Gather Requirements' ) ) ) )

This process represents the steps involved in creating an order package for a customer. It's a complex process that involves reviewing invoices, creating quotes, sending proposals, and meeting deadlines.
This process tree accurately captures the steps involved in creating an order package, which is a common process in many industries, such as sales, customer service, or project management. The process involves reviewing customer needs, creating a quote, and sending a proposal while meeting deadlines and gathering requirements. The use of loop and choice operators reflects the iterative nature of the process and the need to make decisions along the way.
1. **Review Invoice**: This is the first step in creating an order package. The process starts by reviewing an invoice to understand the customer's needs and requirements.
2. **Create Quote & Include Terms**: After reviewing the invoice, the next step is to create a quote that includes all the necessary terms and conditions.
3. **Choose Payment Method or Offer Discount**: The process then moves on to decide how the payment will be made (e.g., credit card, bank transfer) or offer a discount to the customer.
4. **Send Proposal**: Once the quote is ready, the next step is to send a proposal to the customer outlining the terms and conditions of the order package.
5. **Meet Deadline & Gather Requirements**: To ensure timely delivery, the process must meet a deadline and gather all necessary requirements from the customer.


The loop represents the overall Order Package process, 
inner loop represents the iterative process of creating a quote and including terms until it's complete.
* The `X(...)` choice operator in the Choose Payment Method or Offer Discount step allows for two possible outcomes: choosing a payment method or offering a discount.
