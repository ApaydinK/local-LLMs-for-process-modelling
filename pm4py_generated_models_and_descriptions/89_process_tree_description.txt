This process has two halves that run in parallel. The first half starts with Design New Product and Generate Requirements. Generate Requirements is followed by Develop Prototype. Once these three are done, the next step is Finalize Design, followed by Create Technical Specifications, closing the first half. The second half starts with either Conduct Market Research, or with Develop Marketing Strategy. Conduct Market Research would lead to Analyze Customer Feedback, while after Develop Marketing Strategy comes Create Sales Materials. When either Analyze Customer Feedback or Create Sales Materials is finished, the second half is concluded. When both process halves are finished, the process itself is complete.
