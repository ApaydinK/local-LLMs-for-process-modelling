process tree structure: +( ->( +( 'Design New Product', ->( 'Generate Requirements', 'Develop Prototype' ) ), ->( 'Finalize Design', 'Create Technical Specifications' ) ), X( ->( 'Conduct Market Research', 'Analyze Customer Feedback' ), ->( 'Develop Marketing Strategy', 'Create Sales Materials' ) ) )

The process begins with the design and marketing efforts for a new product. Initially, the team generates requirements based on customer needs and develops a prototype. After the prototype is ready, the design is finalized, and technical specifications are created. Concurrently, market research is conducted to understand the target market, followed by analyzing customer feedback. This feedback informs the development of a marketing strategy, and sales materials are then created to promote the product. This approach ensures that both design and marketing activities progress in parallel, with insights from market research and customer feedback guiding the overall strategy.
