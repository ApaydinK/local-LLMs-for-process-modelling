The process I am going to describe contains several loops. I start with Create Proposal for Marketing Campaign. Following that, I have several options. One is to continue with Develop Sales Strategy, after which the process can end. If it does not end, I follow with Conduct Market Research. After this, I can continue either with Analyze Results, going back to Conduct market Research, which is the first loop. Or after Conduct Market Research, I can instead go back to Develop Sales Strategy, which is the second loop. After Create Proposal for Marketing Campaing I could instead of Developing Sales Strategy go a different route, and either get at Review and Approval by Manager, immediately followed by either Collaborate on Sales Strategy or Finalize Sales Strategy. Or, instead of going to my Manager, I can create a Marketing Campain. After any of these outcomes (Sales Strategies or Marketing Campaign), it is back to Creating a Proposal for Marketing Campaign, whcih is the third loop in the process. The process only ever ends after Develop Sales Strategy.
