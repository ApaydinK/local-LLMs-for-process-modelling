Use Case: e-commerce

The shop either gathers product information or processes the order. When product information is gathered this can already finish the process, but if needed also product returns can be handled, while h is done, and the inventory is updated. After that more product information is gathered. The other option to process the order always includes the confirmation of the details of the order as well as processing the order. This can end the process as well. But the is the option to add additional product information while the order is shipped. While this is happening the order is further processed and we jump back to the order being processed.
