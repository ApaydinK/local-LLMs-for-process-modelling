Use Case: e-commerce
This process contains 2 paths to choose. Path 1 begins with Confirm Order Details, ensuring that all the order information is accurate and complete. It then branches into two concurrent options. The first option involves Process Order, where the initial processing takes place, with an alternative option to Process the Order again, ensuring thorough handling. This option also includes Add Additional Product Information, enriching the order with more details, followed by Ship the Order, dispatching the product to the customer.

The second path involves Gather Product Information, collecting necessary details about the products. This path continues with Handle Product Returns, managing any returned items, and includes Update Inventory, ensuring stock levels are adjusted accordingly.
