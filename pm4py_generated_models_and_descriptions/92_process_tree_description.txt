For this process, there are a few things that can happen, but overall, the process is very short. The different things that could happen are Create Budget Report, Identify Key Performance Indicators, Review Financial Statements, Research Market Conditions, Develop Marketing Strategy, or Plan Product Launch. Only one of these is to be done. If we need to Plan Product Launch, then we must Analyze Sales Trends right afterwards, that is the sole exception of this process. If we have done one of the choices the process is done.
