The process begins with two parallel branches: creating a budget report and reviewing financial statements. In the first branch, the process starts by identifying key performance indicators (KPIs) to inform the budgeting process. After the KPIs are identified, a product launch is planned, involving setting a timeline, allocating resources, and defining marketing strategies. Simultaneously, sales trends are analyzed to understand market position, customer behavior, and potential revenue streams. In the second branch, the process starts with reviewing financial statements to gain insights into the company's performance, revenue, and expenses. Following this, market conditions are researched to understand current trends, competitors, and customer needs. Finally, a marketing strategy is developed that aligns with the business goals and objectives. This comprehensive approach ensures a thorough planning and budgeting process for a successful product launch, integrating data-driven decision-making, market research, and strategic planning.
