Use Case: User experiment on new product

This process involves designing a system with several alternative and sequential tasks. It begins with Design System and directly complete the process. Besides, the process provide two alternatives to start: Define Requirements to outline system needs or Conduct User Testing to gather user insights. Next, it offers a choice between Develop Prototype or a nested sequence. In the nested sequence, Enlist Stakeholder Feedback gathers input from key stakeholders. This is followed by Finalize Product Specs, specifying the system details, leading to Harmonize Design Elements, ensuring consistency. The final step in this path is to Gather User Feedback to validate the design, creating a flexible and comprehensive approach to system development.
