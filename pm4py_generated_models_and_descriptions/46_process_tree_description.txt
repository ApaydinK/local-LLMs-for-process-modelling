Use Case: Food delivery

This process model starts with one task: "Prepare Order", when the order is received. Then the seller checks inventory, ensuring that the required items are in stock. Following this the seller has the task to “Fill Shipment”, where the order is packed and prepared for dispatch, and multiple shipments are filled. The follow-up process then is either to Review the Payment, verifying the transaction details, or to confirm shipping, ensuring that the shipment details are accurate and the package is ready for delivery. This ends up the process.
