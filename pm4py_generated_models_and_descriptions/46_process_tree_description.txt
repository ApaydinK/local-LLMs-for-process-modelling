process tree structure: ->( ->( 'Prepare Order', ->( 'Check Inventory', *( 'Fill Shipment', 'Fill Shipment' ) ) ), X( 'Review Payment', 'Confirm Shipping' ) )

Prepare Order: This represents the main process, which starts with preparing an order.

Within the "Prepare Order" process, we have a sub-process that checks the inventory. 

1. The first iteration of the loop is to fill one shipment.
2. The second iteration is also to fill another shipment (likely because there are multiple items or quantities involved).

Once the inventory has been checked and the two shipments have been filled, we reach this point in the process. This represents a choice between two alternatives:

1. Review the payment to ensure everything is correct.
2. Confirm the shipping details.


Process: Prepare Order

1. The process starts by preparing an order.
2. Next, we check the inventory to ensure we have enough stock for the items involved.
3. While checking the inventory, we also fill two separate shipments with the required items (loop `*`).
4. Once the inventory is checked and both shipments are filled, we reach a decision point.
5. Here, we either:
- Review the payment details to ensure everything is correct ( alternative 1).
- Confirm the shipping details (alternative 2).

This process model represents a realistic scenario in an e-commerce or logistics context. The "Prepare Order" process involves setting up a new order, ensuring there's sufficient inventory for the items involved, and then filling the required shipments. The choice between reviewing payment and confirming shipping reflects the need to verify payment details before finalizing the shipping process.
