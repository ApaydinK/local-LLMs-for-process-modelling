**Software Development Process**

The software development process involves several stages that are intertwined to ensure successful project completion. The process begins with **Conduct Requirements Gathering**, which involves gathering and documenting stakeholder requirements.

Once requirements are gathered, the team must **Elaborate Functional Specifications** to define what the software should do. This step is iterative, as it is influenced by **Obtain Stakeholder Feedback**, where stakeholders provide input on the specifications.

The process then splits into two parallel branches:

* The first branch involves **Implement Software Features**, where the team develops specific features based on the functional specifications. This stage includes several subprocesses: implementing individual software components, integrating and testing these components, and performing final testing and quality assurance.
* The second branch deals with refining the software architecture, which involves analyzing requirements, negotiating with stakeholders, gathering feedback from stakeholders, and managing software development.

As the process unfolds, there is a focus on **Manage Software Development**, including liaising with stakeholders, keeping track of progress and issues, and handling project management tasks. This stage also includes finalizing testing and quality assurance, ensuring that all aspects of the software are thoroughly tested.

Throughout the process, there is ongoing feedback from stakeholders, which drives refinement of software components and specifications.

This process model highlights the importance of iterative refinement, stakeholder engagement, and parallel development to ensure successful software development.
