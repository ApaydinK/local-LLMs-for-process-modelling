process tree structure: ->( 'Order_Pizza', ->( X( 'Design_Pattern', *( 'Cut_Toppings', 'Assemble_Slices' ) ), ->( 'Bake_Crust', 'Serve_Fresh' ) ) )

simple description:
Every Process begins when a pizza is ordered. Some pizzas only require designing a pattern before the crust is baked and everything is served fresh, other pizzas require toppings that needs to be cut before the curst is baked and the pizza is freshly served. Rarely toppings need not only to be cut but also followed by an assembly of the topping slices. If the slices need to be assembled then toppings need to be cut again. As soon as all toppings are cut and no further assembling of slices is needed, the curst can be baked and the pizza can be served fresh.
