Use Case: Customer Proposals
The team starts by preparing a proposal in detail for potential customers. If the customers are interested in the proposal, this results in the team reviewing the contract and signing documents with customers. Then the document is returned to team to prepare again another proposal and continue the process. After all documents are signed and confirmed, then either the process ends, or an invoice is sent to customers to ask for payment process. Occasionally, a verifycation of the account balance is needed, in which case they ask for process payment is reissued. Afterwards, new proposals can be prepared. The process will continue until all proposals are processed with all steps above.
