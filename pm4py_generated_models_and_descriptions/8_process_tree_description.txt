This process could be an e-commerce platform that needs to manage orders, inventory, and customer service simultaneously. The iterative workflow begins by ordering new products, then simultaneously different activities are executed, these can be done in any time order or simultaneously. First reports are generated, while also invoices get paid and backorders are cleared. After generating the reports, the orders get packed. Sometimes products of the order are not in stock, so the inventory is verified and restocked. After that the order is packed again. The verifying of inventory and the of packing orders can happen multiple times and can only end after packing orders is done lastly and whenever the invoices are already paid and the backorders as well already cleared. The process usually ends now, but sometimes its required to process returns which triggers the restart of the entire process. Other times processing returns also requires shipping goods, if goods are shipped than more returns must be processed.
