The process at hand consists of four parts. It starts with the parallel execution of the first part (simply 'Review Reports'), and the second part, which again is a parallel execution of the choice of either 'Download Files' or 'Analyze Data', and the third part. The third part is again a parallel execution of simply 'Edit Documents' and the fourth part, which finally is 'Create Presentation' followed by either 'Finalize Report' (forming a loop with 'Create Presentation'), or the termination of the process, should the former parts of the process all have been concluded.
