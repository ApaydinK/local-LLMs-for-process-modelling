Use Case: Product delivery

Whenever any order is in the list, it need to be verified to ensure all details are accurate. Parallel to this is Process Payment, handling the financial transaction. After processing payment, it proceeds to Send Invoice to the customer. This step leads to preparing two parallel tasks: Prepare Shipment for dispatching the order and Receive Return for handling any returned items. Alternatively when order comes, staff needs to Track Package to monitor the shipment's status and Notify Customer at the same time to keep them informed. Those ends up an order and restart when other order comes.
