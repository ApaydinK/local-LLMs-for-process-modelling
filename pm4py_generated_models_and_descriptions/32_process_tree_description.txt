Use Case: Product delivery
At this website the customer can check their packages which will get delivered or he can order a new delivery. When the customer wants to order a new delivery, the order gets verified with the information given by the customer. At the same time the payment is processed, and an invoice is sent. This step leads to preparing two parallel tasks: Prepare Shipment for dispatching the order and Receive Return for handling any returned items. When this process is finished as well as the verification of the order the process is finished. Alternatively, the customer can track their package. This involves the tracking of the package and the notification of the customer at the same time. Therefore the staff needs to Track Package to monitor the shipment's status and Notify Customer at the same time to keep them informed.
