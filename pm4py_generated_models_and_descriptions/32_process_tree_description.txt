process tree structure: X( +( 'Verify Order', ->( 'Process Payment', ->( 'Send Invoice', +( 'Prepare Shipment', 'Receive Return' ) ) ) ), +( 'Track Package', 'Notify Customer' ) )

The process tree represents an order fulfillment process
The process will execute one of these two paths, depending on the outcome of the choices within each path.

- Path 1: This path represents the primary order fulfillment process. It consists of three sequential tasks:

1. Verify Order: This is the starting point, where the process verifies the customer's order details.
2. Process Payment: After verifying the order, the payment processing step begins.
3. Send Invoice: Once the payment is processed, an invoice is sent to the customer.

Path 2: This path represents an alternative scenario where the order is already being processed. It consists of two tasks:

1. Track Package: The process tracks the package's delivery status.
2. Notify Customer: Once the package is delivered, the customer is notified.

Parallel Execution: Both paths are executed in parallel, meaning that they can run concurrently.

Here's a possible execution scenario:

1. The process starts by verifying the order and processing the payment (Path 1).
2. While the payment processing is ongoing, the process also begins tracking the package (Path 2).
3. Once the payment is processed, an invoice is sent to the customer.
4. As the package is being tracked, the delivery status becomes available, and the customer is notified.
