How would I describe my process? Okay, let's see. Well, I always start with conducting an interview, to which I then write a summary. At the same time, I must analyze the results or collect the data, depending on a few factors. Once all of this is completed, often I am done. But there are occasions where I have to make a decision. I start all over again, or I review my report and decide again.
