process tree structure: ->( X( +( 'Prepare', 'Submit' ), *( 'Create', 'Test' ) ), ->( 'Develop', ->( 'Conduct', 'Report' ) ) )

Scenario: Product development
There are three subprocesses
- Subprocess 1: Prepare and Submit.
	+ Prepare: This task likely involves preparing resources or materials needed for the project.
	+ Submit: This task likely involves submitting the prepared material to some authority or reviewing entity.

- Subprocess 2: Create and Test:
	+ Create: This task likely involves designing or developing some aspect of the project (e.g., a report, a prototype, or a design).
	+ Test: This task likely involves verifying or evaluating the created item to ensure it meets certain criteria.

- Subprocess 3: Develop and Report
	+ Develop: This task likely involves refining or elaborating on the created item.
	+ Conduct and Report: This indicates that once development is complete, the process moves on to another sequential subprocess. The `'Conduct'` and `'Report'` tasks are connected in sequence, implying that conducting some activity (e.g., testing or evaluation) is a prerequisite for reporting the results.

In summary, this process model describes a workflow that involves preparing resources, creating and testing an item, developing it further, and finally, conducting and reporting on the outcome. The process tree structure captures the iterative nature of development and testing, as well as the sequential dependencies between tasks.
