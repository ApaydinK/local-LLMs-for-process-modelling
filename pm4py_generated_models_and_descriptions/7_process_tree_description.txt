This process is based on an e-commerce or logistics-related scenario where multiple activities need to be executed to ensure efficient order fulfillment. The process starts and ends with either delivering a product or preparing the inventory or packing a box. The process could also start and end directly with handling an order or shipping a package. However, after handling the order a payment could be processed which would retrigger handling an order. The same structure is valid for shipping a package, this activity could demand tracking of shipments, if this is the case then another package needs to be shipped.
