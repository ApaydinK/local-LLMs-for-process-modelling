For this process, two streams of work happen in parallel. For the first one, a choice must be made between creating a report and generating a summary as well as delivering a package. When either the report or the summary and the package are done, this part is finished. At the same time, complaints need to be handled. More often than not, this comes repeatedly, with booking flights in-between. The second stream of work is either processing a claim or one of two: order a package or pay an invoice. When any one on these is done, and the first half as well, the process ends.
