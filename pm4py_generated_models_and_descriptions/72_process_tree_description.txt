You review a book, and mostly that's it. Done. But sometimes, you have to check the syntax. Following that, you either analyze the code, then test the functionality, then debug issues, and finally repeat the book review. Or you design a pattern. In that case, you either check the syntax again, or you make a graph, before going back to designing a pattern.
