In this process, two lines of work happen all together. For the first line, I either prepare a report for the manager or I review a document by the editor. In that case, I follow up by finalizing the report. Preparing the report for the manager or finalizing the report concludes the first line of work. For the second, I check the email inbox. If it is empty, and the first line of work has concluded, the process ends right here. Otherwise, I follow up on the email inbox checking by responding to important messages from clients. This makes me update the project status. I then check the email inbox again.
