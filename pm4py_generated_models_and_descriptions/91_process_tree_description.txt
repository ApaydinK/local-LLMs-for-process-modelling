The process begins with two parallel tasks: preparing a report for the manager and managing the email inbox. For the report preparation, the initial draft is created, reviewed by an editor, and then finalized based on feedback. Simultaneously, the email inbox is checked regularly, with important client messages being responded to promptly, followed by updating the project status as necessary. This structure ensures that both reporting and email management tasks are handled efficiently in parallel.

In this process, two lines of work happen simultaneously. For the first line, I either prepare a report for the manager. Or I review a document by the editor. In that case, I follow up by finalizing the report. Preparing the report for the manager or finalizing the report concludes the first line of work. For the second,  I check the email inbox. If it is empty, and the first line of work has concluded, the process ends right here. Otherwise, I follow up on the email inbox checking by responding to important messages from clients. This makes me update the project status. I then check the email inbox again.
