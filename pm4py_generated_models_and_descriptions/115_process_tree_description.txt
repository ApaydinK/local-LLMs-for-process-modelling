When the you meet the quality threshold, your work ends. However if you do not meet the threshold, then preparing materials becomes necessary before assembling components and finally testing the prototype. This preparation involves gathering all the necessary resources, tools, and equipment required for the next stages of the process. Assembling components requires putting together the individual parts to create the final product. Testing the prototype ensures that it meets the desired quality standards.
