process tree structure: *( X( 'prepare order', 'order receipt' ), ->( 'processing start', ->( 'data collection', 'report generation' ) ) )

The following work can be repeated over and over. We have two alternatives to choose from: either "prepare an order" or "receive a receipt". Think of this as a sales workflow where customers can either place a new order (prepare order) or receive a confirmation of their existing order (order receipt). Following, processing starts for an order (either new or existing). This might involve data collection and is followed by generating a report to retrieve customer information, product details, shipping addresses, and so on. We generate a report or output based on the collected data. When the report is generated the entire flow starts again with preparing an order or ordering a receipt. The process can only stops after either a order is prepared or a receipt is ordered.
