The process depicts an order of a product, The following work can be repeated over and over. We have two alternatives to choose from: either "prepare an order" or "receive a receipt". Think of this as a sales workflow where customers can either place a new order (prepare order) or receive a confirmation of their existing order (order receipt). Following, processing starts for an order (either new or existing). This might involve data collection and is followed by generating a report to retrieve customer information, product details, shipping addresses, and so on. We generate a report or output based on the collected data. When the report is generated, the entire flow starts again with preparing an order or ordering a receipt. The process can only stop after either an order is prepared or a receipt is ordered.
