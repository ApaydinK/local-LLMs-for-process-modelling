There are two main options to be followed in our restaurant. Depending on if the customer is eating in our restaurant or if the customer is ordering our food and we need to deliver it to him. When following the first main option, you will need to take orders while making food, and sometimes you are also required to prepare coffee and serve food, when we don’t have enough waiters. When following the second main option, you need to pick up food packages from our suppliers and you are responsible for delivering ordered food packages to our customers. By it you need to order the menu of the customer and deliver this menu to the customer.
