############## Improve Description - e.g. highlight the activities #####################
Start by booking a meeting, then prepare a presentation and in the end create handouts or gather materials. Sometimes you already have the presentation prepared and don't need to prepare anymore, then you can deliver the presentation. After the presentation is delivered, set reminders for any follow-up actions (e.g., sending summaries or next steps) and send notifications to attendees or stakeholders as needed. Finally, again gather materials and create handouts that will be distributed at the meeting or shared later.
