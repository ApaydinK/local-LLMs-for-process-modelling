process tree structure: *( *( 'analyze_samples', *( 'extract_features', 'store_results' ) ), *( ->( 'prepare_data', 'run_analysis' ), *( 'interpret_results', 'present_findings' ) ) )What a delightfully complex process tree!

1. Analyzing individual samples by extracting features and storing results.
2. Preparing data for analysis by cleaning, transforming, or aggregating it.
3. Running parallel analyses on the prepared data to generate insights.
4. Interpreting the results and presenting findings in a meaningful way.
5 present findings with statistics and diagrams
