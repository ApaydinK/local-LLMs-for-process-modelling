This process has two parallel branches. The first branch is the choice of either 'Respond to Inquiry' or 'Resolve Issue'. The second branch is the parallel execution of 'Process Order' and a sub process consisting of: First 'Receive Goods', then 'Packaging and Shipping', then 'Prepare Shipping Materials'. After that, either the process terminates, or 'Seal Package' is executed. After 'Seal Package' two things can happen. Either 'Label and Ship', forming a loop with 'Seal Package'. Or looping back to 'Prepare Shipping Materials'.
