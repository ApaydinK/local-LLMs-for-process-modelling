For the given process, I need to either respond to an inquiry or resolve an issue. At the same time, I must also process an order and start a chain of activities. This chain consists of receive goods, then packaging and shipping, then prepare shipping materials. After preparing shipping materials, the process can terminate if all the aforementioned is completed. Or I need to seal the package. I can then return to preparing shipping materials, or I may need to label and ship and then return to seal package. When both subprocesses are completed the whole process terminates.
