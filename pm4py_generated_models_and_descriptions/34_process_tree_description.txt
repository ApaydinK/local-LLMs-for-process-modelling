Process: Academic Paper Publishing Process

Overview: The process gives the option to create a paper, a journal or a book.
If a book is chosen the book gets edited while simultaneously the research of the book has been done. If the paper has been chosen you can write a paper and if necessary multiple articles can be implemented into the paper. Or only a review of a paper can be done. The third option is to publish in a journal. Here the article is submitted while the articles of the journal are gathered. If necessary, more research can be done while also new findings can be added to the journal. At the end every type gets published.
