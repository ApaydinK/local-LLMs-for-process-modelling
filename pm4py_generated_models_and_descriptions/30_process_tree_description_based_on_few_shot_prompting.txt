process tree structure: ->( 'Order_books', *( 'Review_proposals', ->( 'Create_presentation', *( 'Edit_text', 'Finalize_report' ) ) ) )Based on your instructions and examples, I will interpret the given process tree:

->( 'Order_books', *( 'Review_proposals', ->( 'Create_presentation', *( 'Edit_text', 'Finalize_report' ) ) ) )

Here's my description of this process tree:

The process starts with either creating order books or reviewing proposals. The reviewing proposals subprocess consists of two activities: "Create presentation" and a loop of editing text and finalizing reports. This means that the review proposal activity is repeated until the report is finalized.

In other words, the organization reviews proposals and then creates a presentation. Once the presentation is created, it might require some textual content to be reviewed and revised (editing text) until the report is finally ready. This process of reviewing and revising the text can be repeated until satisfaction is achieved.

This process tree describes an iterative refinement process for creating a report based on proposals, where the organization continuously reviews and refines its work until it is satisfied with the final product.
