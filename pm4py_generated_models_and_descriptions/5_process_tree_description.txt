**Process:** Business Plan Development

**Description:**

The process of developing a business plan starts with customer identification and an initial meeting to understand their needs. This is followed by financial planning, where a finance application is prepared.

Next, job descriptions are created, and key performance indicators (KPIs) are set to define the objectives and metrics for measuring success. These two tasks are parallel activities that need to be completed before moving forward with the business plan development process.

The main process of business plan development involves tracking expenses, which includes:

1. **Data Analysis**: Historical data is reviewed to identify trends, patterns, and insights that will inform the business plan.
2. **Grant Writing**: A grant proposal is written based on the findings from the data analysis.

**Key Steps:**

* Customer Identification and Initial Meeting with Customer
* Financial Planning and Finance Application preparation
* Job Description Creation and Key Performance Indicator Setting
* Expense Tracking, Data Analysis, and Grant Writing
