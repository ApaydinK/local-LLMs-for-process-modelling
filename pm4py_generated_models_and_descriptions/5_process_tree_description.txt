The process starts with hiring an engineer, which either ends the process directly or triggers a review of a proposal by the engineer. Sometimes our engineers review a proposal so that they can design a blueprint afterwards. If the blueprint involves hiring a new engineer than another engineer is hired, and the process could end again or as well trigger the reviewal of a new proposal from the new engineer. If the blueprint does not demand to hire a new engineer than a plan is implemented which always leads to approvement of the budget. This implementing plan and approving budget procedure than leads back to design blueprint from where the process continues as described.
