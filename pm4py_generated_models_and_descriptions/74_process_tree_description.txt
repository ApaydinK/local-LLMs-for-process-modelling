In this process, there are nine steps that need to be considered. The first would be to send an invoice. In the meantime, the item must be packaged. Optionally, the package needs shipping, and then we can package the next item. Also in the meantime, we receive the payment. From thereon, we have several options. This can lead to verify authetication. This in turn can lead back to receive payments, or to authenticate, which requires more verify authentication.
Alternatively, after receive payment, we can process the order and then receive the payment; or we may have to check the inventory. If we do, we either proceed with receive payment, or with verify shipping, which makes me check the inventory again.
