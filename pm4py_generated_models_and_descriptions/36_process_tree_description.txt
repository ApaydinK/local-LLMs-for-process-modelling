Use Case: Product development

The process is about designing and developing a new product, which involves prototyping, algorithm development, data evaluation, experimentation, reporting, and material preparation. 
Design Prototype is concurrent to all later activities, initiating the creation of a preliminary model. In operation, the process offers three options: Develop Algorithm, focusing on creating computational methods, Evaluate Data, which involves analyzing collected data, and Conduct Experiment for testing hypotheses. After all of these steps are finished the process can end. But if a report is required, then Finalize Report is conducted, where findings are compiled, followed by Prepare Materials, ensuring all necessary documentation and resources are ready. This then repeats the process if new criteria are updated until the design prototype is done, the data is analyzed and experiment is conducted.
