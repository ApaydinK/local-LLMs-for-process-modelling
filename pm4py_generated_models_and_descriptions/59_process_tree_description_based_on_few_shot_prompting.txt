I would describe the process as follows:

The main process starts with either approving a document, or drafting a proposal and finalizing a budget. In the case of approving a document, this is the end point of the process.

However, if we're in the "draft proposal" or "finalize budget" branch, then the process takes on a different path. First, a document needs to be created. Then, there are two parallel subprocesses that need to be completed: one for briefing the team and discussing the report with stakeholders, and another for sending an email about the document, notifying stakeholders, and sharing the document with the group.

The "briefing" and "discussing" steps can happen independently of each other. The "send email", "notify stakeholders", and "share document" steps are also independent, but they need to be completed sequentially. This suggests that there may be some kind of review or feedback process happening between these steps, where the document is shared with the group after it has been approved by stakeholders.

Overall, this process seems to involve a combination of administrative tasks (like creating and sharing documents) and collaborative work (like briefing the team and discussing the report), all aimed at moving towards some kind of approval or finalization.
