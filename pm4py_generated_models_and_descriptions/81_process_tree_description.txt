This process has two parallel lines of work. The first starts off with design. Then, if also the second line has finished, the process can end. Otherwise, the first line can proceed with either blueprints or specifications, and then back to design. The second line of work is either plan or edit. If edit, it can draft. This means going back to edit. If it does not draft, after design and either plan or edit, the process can end.
