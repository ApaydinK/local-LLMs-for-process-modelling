process tree structure: +( *( 'design', X( 'blueprints', 'specifications' ) ), X( 'plan', *( 'edit', 'draft' ) ) )

The process begins with Design Development and Planning working in parallel.

In the Design Development Track, the process starts with the creation of Design elements, refined through Blueprints (detailed technical designs) and Specifications (clear descriptions of design requirements).

Simultaneously, the Planning Track begins with creating a Plan, refined through iterative Edit (reviews and revisions) and Draft (improvement) stages.

The two tracks converge when the design elements and the plan are finalized, ready for implementation.
