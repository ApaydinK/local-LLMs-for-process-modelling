The process starts with initializing the database. This involves setting up the necessary structures and formats for storing data. Once the database is initialized, then either data is validated or the existen database is backed up. Validation ensures that the data is consistent and accurate, whereas backing up the database creates a secure and reliable copy of the current state. At all times, you have to check for updates.
