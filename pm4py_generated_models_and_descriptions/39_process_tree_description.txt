Use Case: Risk management report

This process starts with Create Report, initiating the documentation process. It then moves sequentially to Conduct Interview, gathering insights, followed by Identify Risks, assessing potential challenges. Concurrently, the process offers alternatives: Estimate Costs, focusing on financial planning, or a nested sequence involving Design Prototype, where initial models are created, along with handling feedback and gathering requirements at the same time. Additionally, it provides a choice between Finalize Proposal, completing the project plan, or Review Document, ensuring all documentation is thorough and accurate.
