Use Case: Risk management report

This process starts with Create Report, initiating the documentation process. It then moves sequentially to Conduct Interview with experts to gather insights, then Risks are identified to assess potential challenges and process ends up here. Concurrently, financial team Estimates Costs, focusing on financial planning, and technical team Designs Prototype. When both tasks are done then process can be completed or continues with Finalize Proposal to complete the project plan and Review Document to ensure all documentation is thorough and accurate. When those are finished then if any changes regars to Cost or Prototype, team needs to work again on cost estimation and prototype design until those are accepted. For more customer engagement, the process is extended after protoype is designed, then team handle feedback and gather requirements at the same time. If any further decision is made as regards Prototype, then it is demanded to be again designed.
