Use Case: Risk management report

This process starts with two separated processes at the same time. First with Create Report, initiating the documentation process. It then moves sequentially to Conduct Interviews with experts to gather insights, then Risks are identified to assess potential challenges and process ends up here. Concurrently, either a financial team Estimates Costs, focusing on financial planning or a technical team designs a prototype. While designing the prototype the team can gather requirements and handle feedback at the same time to further enhance the prototype. This leads back towards the design of the prototype. When both tasks are done the process can be completed or continues with the finalization of the proposal to complete the project plan and Review Document to ensure all documentation is thorough and accurate. When those are finished then if any changes regards to Cost or Prototype, the team needs to work again on cost estimation and prototype design until those are accepted.
