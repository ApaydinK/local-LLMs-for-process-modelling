Use case: Launch new or Update product
Sometimes an old product does not sell well enough. So, we try to update this product or launch a new and better product with a new name. With the demand to launch a new product or to update the product version we have two options. First off, the update of the product always starts with a new design, where the product gets a new look. If the chef is not happy with the new design, the design team needs to conduct research and hire experts to find a better and hopefully final design of the product. But sometimes this can take some more tries. When we decide to build a fully new product the technical team needs to take care of building a prototype, if needed the marketing team needs to gather various feedback and engage stakeholders, so we get a good product. After all this work either by building a new product or a new version we give a proposal to the boss to get budget approved, then all teams need to finalize the design and implement a solution if the budget is not met. This completes the process of generating a new product.
