### build prototype can't be done after design product ### 
Use case: Launch new product
This process model starts with Design Product, where the initial concept is created. It then branches into two paths. The first path involves Conduct Research to gather essential data and Hire Experts to bring specialized skills onboard. The second path offers a choice: Build Prototype, creating an initial version of the product, or Gather Feedback from users and Engage Stakeholders to involve key parties in the process. Following one of these paths, the model proceeds to Approve Budget, ensuring financial resources are allocated properly. This leads to a sequence where Finalize Design refines the product details and Implement Solution brings the design into reality.
