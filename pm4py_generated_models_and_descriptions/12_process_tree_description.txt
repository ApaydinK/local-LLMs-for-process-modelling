The process starts with a choice between two alternatives: "Analyze Data" and a recursive process, where each iteration can involve developing an algorithm or designing a model. The first alternative leads to the process finishing after the data is analyzed. In the recursive process both options lead towards finishing the process. But first the option is given to test the software or to validate the results. If one of these options is chosen the recursive process is repeated. If a model is designed either a report is generated, which gives the option to execute the script and generate a new report or to use the report to further refine the model by designing it more. The other option is to finish the design of the model and continue with the validation or testing and the option the finish the process.
