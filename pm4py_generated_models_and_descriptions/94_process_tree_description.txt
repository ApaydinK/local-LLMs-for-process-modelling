This process can start in two ways.
On the one hand, I can deal with two sub processes at the same time. The first is a choice of either creating a Document or choosing between editing a report or submitting a proposal. Any of those ends the subprocess. The second is the choice between Review Draft and several other choices. The first is to either hire a consultant or decide; interview a candidate or finalize a contract. When any of those are done and the first sub process has ended, the entire process ends. On the other hand, I start with Gather Requirements. Then I can either quit and be done, or I can Approve Requests. In that case, I have to Gather Requirements again.
