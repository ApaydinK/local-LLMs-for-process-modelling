The process involves creating a comprehensive proposal for a consulting project, involving several key activities to ensure the proposal meets client requirements.

The process starts with creating a document that outlines the proposed solution. This document undergoes multiple processes, including editing the report and submitting the proposal. At the same time, there are two parallel branches of activities.

In the first branch, a consultant reviews the draft proposal and provides feedback. If the proposal is acceptable, the process moves forward with finalizing the contract with the client. This branch also includes interviewing candidates to assess their qualifications for the project.

In the second branch, internal processes are carried out, such as gathering all necessary requirements from the client and seeking approval for the proposal. These activities are repeated as necessary to ensure all conditions are met.
