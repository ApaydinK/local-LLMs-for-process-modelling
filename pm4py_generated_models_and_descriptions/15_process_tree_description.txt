After analyzing the process tree, I've distilled the underlying process into a concise description. Here it is:

**Design Office Space**

The process of designing an office space involves two main streams: (1) sourcing potential suppliers and evaluating their options, and (2) specifying furniture requirements and negotiating contract terms.

**Stream 1: Sourcing Potential Suppliers**

* Start by identifying potential suppliers for the office furniture.
* Request product catalogs from these suppliers to get a sense of their offerings.
* Evaluate supplier options based on factors like quality, pricing, and delivery timelines.
* Select the preferred supplier(s) based on the evaluation results.

**Stream 2: Specifying Furniture Requirements**

* Specify the furniture requirements for the office space, including type, quantity, and any specific features (e.g., ergonomic considerations).
* Develop a request for proposal (RFP) to solicit bids from suppliers.
* Send the RFP to selected suppliers, inviting them to submit their proposals.
* Negotiate contract terms with the preferred supplier(s), considering factors like pricing, delivery timelines, and service levels.
* Receive and evaluate proposals from suppliers, comparing their offerings against the specified requirements.

These two streams are interconnected, as the outcome of evaluating supplier options in Stream 1 may influence the selection of a preferred supplier for the furniture requirements in Stream 2. Conversely, the specific requirements for the office space may impact the evaluation process in Stream 1.

The process is designed to ensure that the right suppliers are selected and the best possible solutions are chosen for the office space design.
