The process of designing a new hotel interior involves two main branches. The first branch focuses on creating a hotel design concept, starting with the initial design of the new hotel interior, followed by hotel management planning to prepare for the new design. The second branch is dedicated to evaluating market trends and analyzing customer data. This includes analyzing current market trends in the hotel industry and reviewing existing customer data to inform design decisions. Concurrently, there is a parallel branch that involves booking a conference room for future meetings and events. Within this parallel branch, two additional processes are carried out independently: securing funding for the hotel's expansion and creating a graphic design for a hotel brochure to promote the new interior design.

We can start with design a new hotel interior. Then it would be either create a hotel design concet or the hotel management planning. Alternatively, we can either evaluate market trends for hotels, or analyze customer data. Either way, once this is finished, the next step would be to either book a conference room, or to finance a hotel expansion project. In that case, we also graphic design a hotel brochure. Booking a conference room or graphic designing a hotel brochure ends this process.
