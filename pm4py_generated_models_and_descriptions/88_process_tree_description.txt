We can begin with designing a new hotel interior. Then it would be either create a hotel design concept or the hotel management planning. Alternatively, we can either evaluate market trends for hotels, or analyze customer data. Either way, once this is finished, the next step would be to either book a conference room, or to finance a hotel expansion project. In that case, we also graphic design a hotel brochure. Booking a conference room or graphic designing a hotel brochure ends this process.
