This sequential process contains two major elements. The first element is a choice between the activity 'Prepare Order', and a loop. The mandatory loop part is 'Review Invoice', the optional part is 'Process Payment'. Following the first element, the second is also a choice. One path the process can take is 'Verify Information', after which it terminates. Another path would be 'Validate Data', after which the process can end, or 'Check Consistency' or 'Send Notification' are due. After both, the next step would again be 'Validate Data'.
