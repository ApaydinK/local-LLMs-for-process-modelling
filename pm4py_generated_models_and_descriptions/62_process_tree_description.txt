This process has two major parts, one after another. The first part is as follows: Either I must prepare an order, or I review an invoice. Depending on the outcome, I may process the payment and return to reviewing the invoice again. After this has happened, I get to the second part which is to either verify information (after which the process ends), or to validate data. After data validation the process can end, or it may become necessary to either check consistency or send a notification. After either, the next step would be to validate data again.
