This rather simple process begins in parallel with 'analyze' and a sequence. The first element of the sequence is 'thankYouNote' and 'positiveFeedback', in no particular order. Afterwards, the second element of the sequence is 'escalateToSupport' and 'negativeFeedback', again, in no particular order. Lastly, the process terminates.
