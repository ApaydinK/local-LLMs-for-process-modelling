Use Case: recruitment process
The main flow is that a recruiter Sends Notifications to inform participants about the meetings. After notifications are sent the recruiter needs to Conduct Interviews with candidates or he Hold Discussions with more than one participant at the same time. While this is happening, meetings are scheduled. After those subprocesses the process can end, or the data is further analyzed, and a report is getting done. After that the process is redone with the new information’s and the participants are filtered further
