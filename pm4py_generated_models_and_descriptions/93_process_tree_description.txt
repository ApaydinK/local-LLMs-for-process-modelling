I start by either conducting an Interview, or executing 'g', while hiring a manager. If I have done this I can continue. After hiring a manager, I have the option to do both 'h' and an assessment in any order, before hiring a manager again. If I don't and have either the Interview or 'g' done, this might be sufficient for the process to end. Alternatively, it goes on with any one of Mentor, Team Lead, or Train Employee. After any of those, I go back to hiring a manager.
