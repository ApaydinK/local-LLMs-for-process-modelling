Use Case: Book publication

The process tree represents the publication of a book. It starts with publish, setting the overall goal of making content available and end of process. The parallel operation is to write book, where the main content is created, and also end of process. The next step offers an alternative path: either simultaneously design chapter for visual layout and edit chapter to refine the content, or proceed with publish book, leading to further steps. After publishing book, the next step includes design header for creating section headings and a following process involving format headline to ensure proper structure and headline design for consistency.
