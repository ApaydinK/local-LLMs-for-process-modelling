You start by uploading a book. From then on, there are two ways you can finish this. One option is to generate a report. You might be done then, or you might have to create a database and compile code at the same time. This will force you to generate a report again. Another option would be to download an e-book. You might be done then, or you might upload a file. This can require you to do 'f' and upload the file again, or to download the e-book again, or the make a choice of indexing a pdf or doing 'i'. Whatever you chose, you will have to upload the file again.
