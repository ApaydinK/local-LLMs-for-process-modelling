This is a simple process. I start by preparing an order. Then I am either done, or I face a choice: I either verify a payment, or I process a credit card and ship a package, or vice versa. After shipping a package, I must track the delivery. When either verify payment or both process credit card and track delivery are done, the process reverts to preparing order, which is the only activity, after which a process can normally end.
