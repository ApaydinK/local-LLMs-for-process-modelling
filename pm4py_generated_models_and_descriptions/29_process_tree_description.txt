In this process a restaurant is offering pizza and burgers. When a pizza is ordered (Order Pizza), the staff will Get Ingredients and Fetch Food at the same time. The concurrent process is to Prepare Hamburger where multiple hamburgers can be prepared. If a chicken burger is ordered also multiple chickens can be cooked for the burgers.  Both subprocesses can end up here if the food is taken away. Alternatively, customers can Book Table, where they can Eat Entree (enjoy the food at the restaurant) and simultaneously the staff Deliver Dinner, arranging meal delivery and then Gather Groceries for upcoming days. This process repeats during the opening time of the restaurant.
