The hiring process begins with conducting an interview with the candidate. Depending on the outcome of the interview, the next steps in the process vary. If the candidate performs very well, we will hire the candidate directly. If the candidate does fail to perform but we are still interested, we ask the references provided by the candidate to verify his or her experience.
