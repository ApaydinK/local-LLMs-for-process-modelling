process tree structure: ->( X( 'Computer', 'Order Parts' ), X( 'Design Product', +( ->( 'Assemble Final Product', 'Box' ), 'Test Prototype' ) ) )Based on the provided process tree:

->( X( 'Computer', 'Order Parts' ), X( 'Design Product', +( ->( 'Assemble Final Product', 'Box' ), 'Test Prototype' ) ) )

I will describe the process as follows:

The initial trigger for this process is either receiving a computer order or designing a product. If it's about computers, the focus is on ordering parts related to that specific product. On the other hand, if we're designing a product, there are two parallel subprocesses: assembling the final product and boxing it, as well as testing the prototype.

The process starts with either receiving a computer order or designing a product. If we receive an order for computers, then we need to order parts related to that specific computer. The design of the product is another path where the focus shifts to creating a design for that product. There are two subprocesses in this case: assembling the final product and boxing it, which can be done simultaneously, and testing the prototype.

Once either the computer order or the design process finishes, we move on to handling product returns. For this, the return has to be confirmed. After confirmation of the return, the returned items are processed.
