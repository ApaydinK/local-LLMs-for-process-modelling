process tree structure: ->( X( +( 'Extract', 'Sort' ), *( 'Create', 'f' ) ), X( 'Files', 'Delete' ) )

The process involves organizing and cleaning up files. It starts with two main branches executed sequentially.

In the first branch, relevant information is extracted from the files and sorted. Alongside this, thumbnails for the sorted files are created. This ensures that all important data is organized and visually accessible.

The second branch focuses on cleanup. It identifies files that need to be deleted, such as duplicates or unnecessary versions, and removes them. This step helps to free up storage space and maintain a tidy file system.

Overall, this process efficiently manages files by organizing important data and eliminating unnesessary.
