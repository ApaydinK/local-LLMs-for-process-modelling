If I have to verify a report, I do that, and then I am finished. If not, then that means that I either have to conduct an interview or review an application. After either, the process may end. Or another step is necessary, requiring me to either evaluate a candidate or generate a proposal. When that is done, I would have to again conduct an interview or review an application.
