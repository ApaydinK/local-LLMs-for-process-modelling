I start by both generating an invoice and handling the return. After the handle return, I ship the package. After generating an invoice, I inspect the product and prepare the order, in no particular order. Simultaneously to all of this, I fulfill a request. Sometimes, when all of this is done, I am finished. Other times, I have to process a payment and either authorize a transaction or verify information, then go back to request fulfillment.
