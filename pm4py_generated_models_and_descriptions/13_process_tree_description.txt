This is the top-level process that should visualize different services with a twist. Our specialty is that catering has to be odered first, so that food is delivered to the fridge of the customer, then one out of three decisions can be taken. First decision option is to choose a guest arrival time, the second decision option is to prepare food and cutlery and the third decision option is to arrange a delivery. When all of these steps are done and the decision is made, then and only then a reservation can be booked at our special hotel where the guest either can enjoy a stay at the hotel by reserving a hotel room or the guest can select cutlerery to keep the experience as a memory.
