process tree structure: *( +( 'Schedule Meetings', ->( 'Send Notifications', X( 'Hold Discussions', 'Conduct Interviews' ) ) ), ->( 'Analyze Data', 'Prepare Report' ) )The task at hand is to analyze a process tree and determine if it is feasible based on the operators used.

From the given process tree, we can see the following operators:

1. ->(...) sequence
2. X(...) choice

The process tree contains multiple sequences, where each sequence consists of several tasks (e.g., 'Schedule Meetings', 'Send Notifications', 'Conduct Interviews', etc.). These sequences are connected by the choice operator (X(...)).

To ensure that all instances in the process tree are feasible, we need to check if each sequence is possible based on the operators used. Here's a breakdown of each sequence:

1. ('Schedule Meetings', 'Send Notifications', 'Conduct Interviews', 'Analyze Data', 'Prepare Report')
   - This sequence appears multiple times in the process tree and does not contain any choice operators.
   - Therefore, this sequence is feasible.

2. ('Schedule Meetings', 'Send Notifications', 'Hold Discussions', 'Analyze Data', 'Prepare Report')
   - This sequence also appears multiple times and does not contain any choice operators.
   - Therefore, this sequence is feasible.

3. ('Schedule Meetings', 'Send Notifications', 'Conduct Interviews', 'Analyze Data', 'Prepare Report', 'Schedule Meetings', 'Send Notifications', 'Hold Discussions', 'Analyze Data', 'Prepare Report')
   - This sequence contains two instances of the first sequence and an additional choice operator.
   - Since all sequences are feasible, this sequence is also feasible.

4. ('Schedule Meetings', 'Send Notifications', 'Conduct Interviews', 'Analyze Data', 'Prepare Report', ... (repeated patterns))
   - These sequences contain multiple repeated patterns of the first two sequences, which we have already determined to be feasible.
   - Therefore, these sequences are also feasible.

In conclusion, all instances in the process tree are feasible based on the operators used. The process tree is feasible.
