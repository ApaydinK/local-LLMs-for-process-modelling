The work structure in our bakery is straight forward. While our salespersons do things, let’s call it c and then b. You will work as a baker. This involves two possible things. Either you will prepare ingredients and bake the cakes and while the cake is baking you mix the batter. If you still have time, you can also pour the batter into molds. The other thing you will be doing is to work with the finished cakes. You will glaze the cake, slice the baked cake and serve it or you will package the cakes for storage. That’s all you need to do until your shift is finished.
