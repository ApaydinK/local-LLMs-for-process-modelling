For the given process, there are two streams of activities that I run in parallel. One would be to Design Report, potentially requiring Review Document and back to Design Report. This may happen multiple times. The other would be a choice of Conduct Interview or Gather Information or a special activity called 'f', which is always followed by Create Proposal. After both streams of activities have completed, I am done.
