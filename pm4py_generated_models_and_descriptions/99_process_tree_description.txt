The process begins with reviewing the report, followed by two main branches of activities. The first branch focuses on planning and development. It starts with planning the project, then proceeds with a loop of repeated tasks which include interviewing candidates, training new team members, and concurrently mentoring junior colleagues while analyzing data and evaluating performance metrics. The second branch involves conducting surveys to gather relevant data, followed by hiring new employees based on the survey results and other criteria. This structured approach ensures efficient talent acquisition, development, and project planning within the organization.


*********************************** Yorck ***********************************
For this process, while doing everything else, you can always review the report, because it needs to be done anyway. Apart from this, you can plan a project. If you do, you will also need to conduct a survey or hire an employee. Or, you interview a candidate. This can last for several rounds (with training a newbie inbetween) or only once. When you are done, there is two ways it can proceed from here. Either with conducting a survey or hire an employee, just like I mentioned before. Or by both mentoring a junior and by analyzing data and evaluating the performance in any order. When all three of these are acomplished, you will need to interview a candidate again.
