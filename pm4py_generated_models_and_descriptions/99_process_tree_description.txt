For this process, while doing everything else, you can always review the report, because it needs to be done anyway. Apart from this, you can plan a project. If you do, you will also need to conduct a survey or hire an employee. Or you interview a candidate. This can last for several rounds (with training a newbie in-between) or only once. When you are done, there is two ways it can proceed from here. Either with conducting a survey or hire an employee, just like I mentioned before. Or by both mentoring a junior and by analyzing data and evaluating the performance in any order. When all three of these are accomplished, you will need to interview a candidate again.
