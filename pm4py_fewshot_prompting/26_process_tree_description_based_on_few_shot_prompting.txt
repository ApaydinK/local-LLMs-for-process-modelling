process tree structure: *( *( 'Prepare a Proposal', ->( 'Review Contract', 'Sign Document' ) ), ->( 'Send Invoice', *( 'Process Payment', 'Verify Account Balance' ) ) )Here's my interpretation of the given process tree:

Process Tree:
*( *( 'Prepare a Proposal', ->( 'Review Contract', 'Sign Document' ) ), ->( 'Send Invoice', *( 'Process Payment', 'Verify Account Balance' ) ) ) )

Description: This process represents a commercial transaction between a supplier and a customer. The process starts with "Prepare a Proposal," where the supplier prepares an offer for the customer.

The proposal is then reviewed by the customer, who may either accept or reject it. If accepted, the supplier must review the contract to ensure all terms are agreeable. Once the contract is finalized, the supplier signs the document, marking the beginning of the agreement.

Concurrently, the supplier sends an invoice to the customer for the agreed-upon payment. The process then enters a nested loop: "Process Payment" and "Verify Account Balance." These two activities operate in parallel, indicating that the supplier must verify the customer's account balance while processing their payment.

In this scenario, if the payment is successful and the account balance verifies, the transaction is complete, marking the end of the process.
