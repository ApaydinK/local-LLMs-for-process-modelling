process tree structure: ->( 'Prepare Order', +( 'Review Invoice', ->( 'Process Payment', *( 'Pack Item', 'Ship Package' ) ) ) )Based on the given process tree:

->( 'Prepare Order', +( 'Review Invoice', ->( 'Process Payment', *( 'Pack Item', 'Ship Package' ) ) ) )

Here's the description:

This process begins with Prepare Order, setting the stage for a new order. It then moves to Review Invoice, ensuring all necessary information is accurate and complete. The next step is Process Payment, where payment processing occurs. Within this step, two parallel activities take place: Pack Item, which involves preparing the physical product for shipping, and Ship Package, which sends the package to the customer.

In summary, this process model illustrates an e-commerce order fulfillment workflow, starting with order preparation, followed by invoice review and payment processing, culminating in packaging and shipping the ordered items.
