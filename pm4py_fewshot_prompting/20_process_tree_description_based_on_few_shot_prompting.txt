process tree structure: +( ->( 'Conduct Experiment', ->( 'Analyze Results', 'Collect Samples' ) ), +( 'Prepare Data', 'Summarize Findings' ) )Here's my attempt to describe the given process tree:

process tree: +( ->( 'Conduct Experiment', ->( 'Analyze Results', 'Collect Samples' ) ), +( 'Prepare Data', 'Summarize Findings' ) )

Expected Description:
This scientific research process starts by conducting an experiment, a crucial step in gathering data. The analysis of results and the collection of samples are nested activities that must be completed before moving forward. Once these steps are finished, the process splits into two parallel paths: preparing the data for further analysis and summarizing the findings from the experiment. This process tree represents a flexible workflow management system where researchers can choose to focus on either preparing their data or summarizing their results simultaneously.

Please let me know if my interpretation is correct!
