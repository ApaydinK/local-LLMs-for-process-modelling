process tree: ->( 'Order_Pizza', ->( X( *( 'Cut_Toppings', 'Assemble_Slices' ), 'Design_Pattern' ), ->( 'Bake_Crust', 'Serve_Fresh' ) ) )

Description:
This pizza ordering process begins with the "Order_Pizza" step, where a customer places their order. The process then splits into two parallel paths: one for designing the pizza and one for preparing it.

The design path involves cutting toppings and assembling slices (Cut_Toppings and Assemble_Slices) in an unspecified sequence, followed by designing a pattern (Design_Pattern). This suggests that the pizza designer is creating a unique design for the customer's order.

Meanwhile, the preparation path involves baking the crust (Bake_Crust) and serving the pizza fresh (Serve_Fresh), indicating that the pizza is being prepared for delivery or pickup. The two paths are independent, allowing for flexibility in the workflow management.

Overall, this process model demonstrates a simple yet efficient way to manage a pizza ordering system, with a focus on design and preparation. It highlights the importance of parallel processing to ensure timely service and customer satisfaction.
