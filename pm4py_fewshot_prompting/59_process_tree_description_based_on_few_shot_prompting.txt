**Process Tree:** X( ->( 'to approve document', X( 'to draft proposal', 'to finalize budget' ) ), *( 'to create document', X( +( 'to brief team', 'to discuss report with stakeholders' ), ->( 'to send email to group about document', ->( 'to notify stakeholders about report', 'to share document with group' ) ) ) ) )

**Description:**
This process begins with the approval of a document, which involves drafting a proposal and finalizing a budget. This is followed by creating a document, which has two parallel paths.

The first path starts with briefing a team and discussing a report with stakeholders. These activities are executed in sequence, resulting in sending an email to a group about the document, notifying stakeholders about the report, and sharing the document with the group.

The second path involves a loop that repeats the process of creating a document until it is complete. This loop provides flexibility in managing the workflow, allowing for multiple iterations before finalizing the document.

In summary, this process requires approval of a document, followed by creation and refinement of the document through team briefing, stakeholder discussion, and iterative email notifications.
