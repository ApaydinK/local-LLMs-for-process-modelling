Description:
This process starts with reviewing a report, indicating the importance of assessing and understanding the current situation. The process then moves to planning a project, which involves two nested activities:

* Interviewing candidates and training new employees to identify the best fit for the role.
* Mentoring junior staff members, which includes evaluating their performance and analyzing data to make informed decisions.

The parallel branch in this level offers alternative paths: hiring an employee or conducting a survey to gather more information. This flexibility allows the process to adapt to changing circumstances and priorities.

Overall, this process is focused on building a team by recruiting the right talent and ensuring that new hires are properly trained and mentored.
