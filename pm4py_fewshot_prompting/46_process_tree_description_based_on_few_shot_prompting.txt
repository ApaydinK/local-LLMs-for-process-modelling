process tree structure: ->( ->( 'Prepare Order', ->( 'Check Inventory', *( 'Fill Shipment', 'Fill Shipment' ) ) ), X( 'Confirm Shipping', 'Review Payment' ) )Here is my attempt to describe the given process tree:

Process Tree 1:
->( ->( 'Prepare Order', ->( 'Check Inventory', *( 'Fill Shipment', 'Fill Shipment' ) ) ) ), X( 'Confirm Shipping', 'Review Payment' ) )

Description: This e-commerce fulfillment process starts with Prepare Order, which initiates the order preparation process. Within this step, Check Inventory is performed to verify the availability of products. The process then enters a loop, where Fill Shipment is executed multiple times to prepare the shipment. After the shipment is prepared, the process branches into two alternative paths: Confirm Shipping, which ensures that the shipment is processed correctly, and Review Payment, which verifies the payment status. This combination of sequence, choice, and loop operators enables efficient order fulfillment while ensuring accurate tracking of inventory and payment.

Process Tree 2: I couldn't create a new tree because you only provided one example process tree.

However, if you would like me to describe the given process tree again or create a new one based on your request, please let me know!
