Here is the description:

This process begins with creating a proposal for a marketing campaign, which involves developing a marketing strategy and collaborating with others to finalize the sales strategy. The process then branches into two parallel paths: one focused on reviewing and approving the proposal by a manager, while the other leads to conducting market research and analyzing results to inform the sales strategy.

In the first path, creating a proposal for a marketing campaign involves:

* Reviewing and approving the proposal by a manager
* Finalizing the sales strategy with collaboration from others

This process offers flexibility in workflow management, allowing for simultaneous review and approval while also enabling collaboration on the sales strategy.

The second path is focused on developing the sales strategy, which includes:

* Conducting market research to gather data and insights
* Analyzing results to inform the sales strategy

These two parallel paths illustrate how marketing campaign development involves both internal approvals and external market research to drive the sales strategy.
