process tree structure: +( *( 'design', X( 'blueprints', 'specifications' ) ), X( 'plan', *( 'edit', 'draft' ) ) )Here is the description of process tree 1:

This process starts with design, an essential step to create blueprints and specifications for a project. This activity is followed by two parallel paths: plan and (edit or draft). The plan path is further divided into edit and draft, allowing for iterative refinement of the plan.

process tree: +( *( 'design', X( 'blueprints', 'specifications' ) ), X( 'plan', *( 'edit', 'draft' ) ) ) )

Description: This process begins by designing blueprints and specifications to define project goals. It then branches into two paths: one focused on planning, with the option to refine the plan through editing or drafting.
