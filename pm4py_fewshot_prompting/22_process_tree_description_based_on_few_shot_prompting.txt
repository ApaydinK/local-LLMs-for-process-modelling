process tree structure: *( *( 'analyze_samples', *( 'extract_features', 'store_results' ) ), *( ->( 'prepare_data', 'run_analysis' ), *( 'interpret_results', 'present_findings' ) ) )I'm excited to interpret this process tree!

**Process Tree 1:**
*( *( 'analyze_samples', *( 'extract_features', 'store_results' ) ), *( ->( 'prepare_data', 'run_analysis' ), *( 'interpret_results', 'present_findings' ) ) )

This process starts with a loop that repeatedly analyzes samples, extracting features and storing results. Within this loop, there are two parallel branches:

1. **Prepare Data** and **Run Analysis**: These activities work together to prepare the data for analysis and then run the actual analysis.
2. **Interpret Results** and **Present Findings**: Once the analysis is complete, these activities help interpret the results and present them to stakeholders.

The process tree structure indicates that the loop will continue until all samples have been analyzed, and then it will move on to the next phase.

In summary, this process involves analyzing multiple samples, extracting relevant features, storing results, preparing data for each analysis, running the analyses, interpreting the results, and presenting findings to stakeholders.
