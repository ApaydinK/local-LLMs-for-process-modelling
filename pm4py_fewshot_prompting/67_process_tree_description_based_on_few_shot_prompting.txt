process tree structure: *( 'Order Parts', +( *( 'Assemble Frame', 'Attach Handles' ), +( +( 'Connect Brackets', +( 'Pack Final Product', 'Install Wheels' ) ), 'Unpack Components' ) ) )I'm excited to dive into process tree 1:

*( 'Order Parts', +( *( 'Assemble Frame', 'Attach Handles' ), +( +( 'Connect Brackets', +( 'Pack Final Product', 'Install Wheels' ) ), 'Unpack Components' ) ) )

Here's the description of this process:

This process starts with "Order Parts", a critical step that sets the stage for the entire workflow. The process then branches into two parallel paths: Assemble Frame and Attach Handles, which together form a crucial part of the overall process.

Next, we have a nested loop that represents the assembly of the final product. This loop consists of three activities:

1. Connect Brackets
2. Pack Final Product
3. Install Wheels

Each of these activities contributes to the ultimate goal of assembling and packaging the product. The Unpack Components step serves as an entry point into this nested loop, indicating that the process begins with receiving or accessing the necessary components.

The overall workflow is designed to ensure that each step is completed before moving on to the next one, ultimately resulting in a fully assembled and packaged product.
