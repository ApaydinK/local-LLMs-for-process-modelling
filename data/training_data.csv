"->( X( 'Receive_Order', +( 'Fill_Consolidation_Orders', 'Place_Order_for_Supply_Chains' ) ), ->( 'Confirm_Product_Return', 'Process_Returned_Items' ) )","The initial trigger that sets off the entire process is either the receival of an order or a parallel subprocess. The parallel subprocess consists of the activities 'place order for supply chains' and 'fill consolidation order'. Once the receival of an order or the parallel subprocesses finishes, the focus shifts to handling product returns. For this, the product return has to be confirmed. Once the return is confirmed, the returned items are processed. "
"->( 'Order_Pizza', ->( X( *( 'Cut_Toppings', 'Assemble_Slices' ), 'Design_Pattern' ), ->( 'Bake_Crust', 'Serve_Fresh' ) ) )","Every Process begins when a pizza is ordered. Some pizzas only require designing a pattern before the crust is baked and everything is served fresh, other pizzas require toppings that needs to be cut before the crust is baked and the pizza is freshly served. Rarely toppings need not only to be cut but also followed by an assembly of the topping slices. If the slices need to be assembled then toppings need to be cut again. As soon as all toppings are cut and no further assembling of slices is needed, the curst can be baked and the pizza can be served fresh."

Sometimes you already have the presentation prepared and don't need to prepare anymore, then you can deliver the presentation. After the presentation is delivered, set reminders for any follow-up actions (e.g., sending summaries or next steps) and send notifications to attendees or stakeholders as needed. Finally, gather materials or create handouts that will be distributed at the meeting or shared later."

The main work starts with designing. Then compiling the designed code into an executable form. Evaluate the compiled code against a set of predefined criteria or metrics, such as performance, security, or usability. Sometimes the evaluation is done first and then the generation. If generations and evaluations are performed then this leads to a restart of compile. Finally the compiled code is ready to be either validated by a focus group or tested by the developer."

In other instances the organization reviews a document and then prepares a research proposal. The proposal then is finalized by analyzing findings  or gathering additional data to be presented. However, sometimes additional information is needed. In this case, a meeting with the professor is scheduled as well as a video call with the project partner is hold. The meeting with the professor and the project partners are independend from each other. Also a decision has to be made about inviting more collaborators with expertise or simply conduct a brainstorming session to gather ideas from the people already involved in the proposal. If additional information is gathered in this way, then the process is kicked off again, i.e. either a report is created or the new document is reviewed etc."
"*( 'Hire Engineer', ->( 'Review Proposal', *( 'Design Blueprint', ->( 'Implement Plan', 'Approve Budget' ) ) ) )","The process starts with hiring an engineer, which either ends the process directly or triggers a review of an proposal by the engineer. Sometimes our engineers review a proposal so that they can design a blueprint afterwards. If the bluebprint involves to hire a new engineer than another engineer is hired and the process could end again or as well trigger the reviewal of a new proposal from the new engineer. If the blueprint does not demand to hiere a new engineer than a plan is implemented which always leads to approvement of the budget. This implementing plan and approving budget procedure than leads back to design blueprint from where the process continues as described."
"*( +( 'Prepare Order', 'Review Payment' ), +( 'Authorize Payment', *( 'Process Refund', *( 'Collect Personal Data', 'Verify Information' ) ) ) )","This process starts by preparing an order and reviewing a payment or by reviewing a payment and preparing an order. Once the initial two steps are completed in any order, the process ends or the focus shifts to authorizing the payment and processing a refund. Here, it does not matter again of the refund is first processed and the the payment is authorized. Now is an interesting part of the process, after the refund is processed, personal data coud be collected and then verfied multiple times. if the verification is not necessary anymore this path of the process goes back to the the processement of the refund. If the payment is authorized and the process is refunded, the entire process starts again. The whole loop can only be stopped after executing the initial two steps reviewing a payment and preparing an order."

The process starts and ends with either delivering a product, or preparing the inventory or packing a box. The process could also start and end directly with handling an order, or shipping a package. However after handling the order a payment could be processed which would retrigger handling an order. Same is valid for shipping a package, this activity could demand tracking of shipments, if this is the case then another package needs to be shipped."

The iterative workflow begins by ordering new products, then simultaneously many activities are executed, like generate reports, pay invoices and clear backorders. After generating reports, follows pack orders and sometimes additionally verify inventory is performed. If verify inventory is performened, then more orders are packed. Verifing inventory and packing orders can happen multiple times, and can only end after packing orders is done lastly and whenever the invoices are already paid and the backorders as well already cleared. The process usually ends now, but sometimes its required to process returns which triggers the restart of the entire process. Other times processing returns also requires shipping goods, if goods are shipped than more returns have to be processed."

However, the full process contains several more steps that are also commonly executed. The process involves reviewing invoices after ordering packages, then creating a quote where terms need to be included. The creation of quotes and inclusion of terms can be done again and again until the final quote is created where then a decision is made between offering a discount or choosing a payment method. From here either the process restarts with order package or a propasal needs to be send. When a proposal is sent an invoice is reviewed again and it continues as described previosly from the review of the invoice or when its urgent, a deadline needs to be meet sometimes this requires to gather requirements on what to achieve. It is possible that several deadlines need to be meet. As soon as a dealine needs to be meet that does not require to gather more requirements, the process restarts with order package."

We have two alternatives to choose from: either 'prepare an order' or 'receive a receipt'. Think of this as a sales workflow where customers can either place a new order (prepare order) or receive a confirmation of their existing order (order receipt). Following, processing starts for an order (either new or existing). This might involve data collection and is followed by generating a report to retrieve customer information, product details, shipping addresses, and so on. We generate a report or output based on the collected data. When the report is generated the entire flow starts again with preparing an order or ordering a receipt. The process can only stops after either a order is prepared or a receipt is ordered. "

The process involves designing a prototype, developing algorithms and integrating new features to the existing software. All of the designing, developing and integrating steps are performed a number of times until finally one group is responsible to analyze improvement results and therefore conduct experiments repeatedly and parallelly another group is responsible for either implementing the changes or testing compatibility, often debugging several errors and fixing various bugs."

We offer to you to do the refinement of the design and the edit of the details until you are satisfied.

On a busy day your work already ends with these tasks. However if you have time then prepare orders and help team A by managing some of their customers. In this case do what you would do for your own customers, i.e. first send packages and then process the returns before doing the product quality verifications and storage of data when necessary.
